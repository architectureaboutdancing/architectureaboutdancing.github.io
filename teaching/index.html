<h1>teaching</h1>
<article>
    <p>I am a qualified teacher and hold a Post-Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) with a specialism in mathematics.
Although most of my time and focus is now upon research, I&rsquo;ve kept up my teaching practice via the Software Carpentry organisation. With support from other volunteer instructors around the world, I teach basic programming skills (version control using git, bash shell scripting and python) to researchers at Imperial College London and beyond. If you are looking for someone to deliver a Software Carpentry lesson at your institution and think I may be able to help, please <a href="https://lucydot.github.io/blog/about/">get in contact</a>.</p>

(Not to be confused with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evETS8_WFGE">The Carpenters</a>)
</font></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve developed some resources for teaching an Introduction to the Python Pandas (data analysis) library which can be found <a href="https://github.com/lucydot/feed-your-python">here</a>.</p>

<p>Before starting my PhD, I worked as a trainee teacher at Winson Green Prison in Birmingham (UK) where I taught secondary school mathematics to male prisoners. I have also worked with women caught up in the criminal justice system: as a volunteer teacher at Riker&rsquo;s Island Prison, New York and paid work at Anawim Women&rsquo;s Centre, Birmingham. However the majority of my teaching experience was as a mathematics teacher at an inner city primary school in Birmingham. I was employed to teach national curriculum mathematics to children aged 9-11, although the job was nice and varied and also included training student teachers and teaching assistants. I also got to cover the back wall of my classroom with a big Sierpinski triangle and tell the kids about <a href="https://magoosh.com/gre/2011/what-a-naughty-boy-can-teach-us-about-adding/">what a naughty boy Gauss was</a>.</p>
